## Overview  
The Real-Time Chat Application is a fully functional web-based chat platform built using React, Socket.io, and Vite. This application allows users to join chat rooms, send and receive messages instantly, and view live typing indicators. It supports both one-on-one and group chats, making it suitable for small teams, communities, or casual conversations.  

The app is designed with a modern, responsive UI, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. It utilizes WebSockets to enable real-time communication, ensuring instant message delivery without page reloads.  

## Key Features  

### Real-Time Messaging  
- Users can send and receive messages instantly, without delays or page refreshes.  
- Messages are delivered using Socket.io, ensuring a seamless experience.  

### Join and Create Chat Rooms  
- Users can enter a unique room name to create or join an existing chat room.  
- Each chat room maintains its messages separately.  

### Typing Indicators  
- The app detects when a user is typing and displays a "User is typing..." message to others in the chat.  
- The typing indicator disappears after a few seconds of inactivity.  

### Responsive and Modern UI  
- The application is styled using CSS & Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface.  
- Works across devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.  

### Powered by WebSockets  
- Built with Socket.io, which provides a persistent WebSocket connection for real-time data exchange.  

### Fast Performance with Vite  
- Uses Vite as the frontend bundler, ensuring a lightweight and fast development experience.  

## Technology Stack  

- React.js : Frontend UI framework |
- Socket.io : Real-time WebSocket communication |
- Vite : Fast build tool for React |
- Node.js & Express : Backend server to handle WebSockets |

## How It Works  

1. User joins a room by entering a name and room ID.  
2. Messages are sent to all users within the same room.  
3. When a user starts typing, a "typing indicator" appears for others in the room.  
4. Messages are displayed in a chat window in real-time.  

## Future Enhancements  

- User Authentication (e.g., Login with Google)  
- Chat History Persistence using a database (MongoDB or Firebase)  
- File Sharing & Image Uploads  
- Private Messaging / Direct Chats
